## Architecture

This package incorporates PHP code that is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project from the [GearLab Tool API Spec](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/ctamayo/gearlab-tools/v2). The generated code is exported automatically when the spec is saved in Swagger Hub, and is contained entirely in the `swagger/SwaggerClient-php` directory within this repo. The Composer autoloader is configured to autoload this code:

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
          "Swagger\\Client\\": "swagger/Swagger-Client-php/lib/",
          "GearLab\\Api\\": "src/"
        }
    },
    "autoload-dev": {
        "psr-4": {
          "Swagger\\Client\\" : "swagger/Swagger-Client-php/test/",
          "GearLab\\Api\\": "test/"
        }
    }
}
```

The `GearLab\Api\Client` class serves as the main entrypoint for all API calls, and normalizes the usage of the autogenerated code. For example, it translates array query arguments into positional arguments that the autogen code expects.
